          </svg></a>Shortly and simply why?</h2>
  <p>There is a growing number of sensors, cameras and measuring devices in the
      public space. Why are they hanging on the lamp post? What are they measuring?
      And by whom? Those questions are relevant to the citizens to be assured that no
      private and sensitive data are collected without their approvement. At the same
      time the municipalities feel obligated to provide a transparency about the
      hanging devices to the inhabitants and provide a good working registration tool
      to the owners of the measuring devices. The sensor owners would value the
      clarity about the process to register their devices and uniformity in the
      legislation if they plan to install their devices throughout more cities. We
      cannot forget about researchers, developers and data scientists who would highly
      appreciate the transparency about the measuring devices and potential access to
      their data. The National Sensor Registry seems to be the solution to answer the
      abovementioned questions. The registry would:</p>
  <ul>
      <li>provide transparency to the municipalities and citizens about the data
          collected by the devices and the purpose for collection;</li>
      <li>Provide overview and insight into where sensors are placed in public space
          and who is the owner</li>
      <li>allow sensor owners to register the devices in an uniform way;</li>
      <li>provide access to highly demanded data to utilize the smart city concept;</li>
      <li>act as a platform that provides transparent, safe and secure environment
          where citizens and entrepreneurs can get more information or make objections
          against the reason behind collecting data.</li>
